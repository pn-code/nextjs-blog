# nextjs-blog

This NextJS Blog app with PostgreSQL and Bootstrap for styles.

At the time I am starting this project, I do not have experience in relational databases, such as PostgreSQL. I also have not worked with Bootstrap before. However, I hope to learn these new technologies by developing this blog project.

Please check user_stories to see what I am looking to create as a final product.
